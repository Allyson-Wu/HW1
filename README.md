//Course: 
CS 472/572: Object-Oriented Design Patterns

//Experience:
This is my first semester at BSU, and the OODP course is more complex than I had imagined. I find myself constantly Googling, referring to the textbook, and watching YouTube videos to help me grasp the course content. However, I believe that understanding patterns like composite and strategy, as well as other patterns I will learn, will be beneficial for my future. I am committed to ongoing learning!
